About LAMMPS and this manual
============================

LAMMPS stands for **L**\ arge-scale **A**\ tomic/**M**\ olecular
**M**\ assively **P**\ arallel **S**\ imulator.

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code focusing on
materials modeling.  It was designed to run efficiently on parallel
computers and to be easy to extend and modify.  Originally developed at
Sandia National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility, LAMMPS
now includes contributions from many research groups and individuals
from many institutions.  Most of the funding for LAMMPS has come from
the US Department of Energy (DOE).  LAMMPS is open-source software
distributed under the terms of the GNU Public License Version 2 (GPLv2).

The `LAMMPS website <lws_>`_ has a variety of information about the
code.  It includes links to an online version of this manual, an
`online forum <https://www.lammps.org/forum.html>`_ where users can post
questions and discuss LAMMPS, and a `GitHub site
<https://github.com/lammps/lammps>`_ where all LAMMPS development is
coordinated.

The manual is organized into three parts:

1. The :ref:`User Guide <user_documentation>` with information about how
   to obtain, configure, compile, install, and use LAMMPS,
2. the :ref:`Programmer Guide <programmer_documentation>` with
   information about how to use the LAMMPS library interface from
   different programming languages, how to modify and extend LAMMPS,
   the program design, internal programming interfaces, and code
   design conventions,
3. the :ref:`Command Reference <command_reference>` with detailed
   descriptions of all input script commands available in LAMMPS.
