  .. admonition:: Web Browser Compatibility
     :class: note

     The HTML version of the manual makes use of advanced features present
     in "modern" web browsers.  This leads to incompatibilities with older
     web browsers and specific vendor browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer on Windows)
     where parts of the pages are not rendered as expected (e.g. the layout is
     broken or mathematical expressions not typeset).  In that case we
     recommend to install/use a different/newer web browser or use
     the `PDF version of the manual <https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.pdf>`_.

     The following web browser versions have been verified to work as
     expected on Linux, macOS, and Windows where available:

     - Safari version 11.1 and later
     - Firefox version 54 and later
     - Chrome version 54 and later
     - Opera version 41 and later
     - Edge version 80 and later

     Also Android version 7.1 and later and iOS version 11 and later have
     been verified to render this website as expected.
