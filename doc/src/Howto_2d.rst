 2d simulations
================

You must use the :doc:`dimension <dimension>` command to specify a 2d
simulation.  The default is 3d.

A 2d simulation box must be periodic in z as set by the :doc:`boundary
<boundary>` command.  This is the default.

If using the :doc:`create_box <create_box>` command, you must define a
simulation box which straddles z = 0.0 in the z dimension since all
the atoms will have a z coordinate of zero.  Typicaily the width of
box in the z dimension should be narrow, e.g. -0.5 to 0.5, but that is
not required.  Example are:

.. code-block:: LAMMPS

   create_box 1 -10 10 0 10 -0.5 0.5
   create_box 1 -10 10 0 10 -0.25 0.25

Likewise, if using the :doc:`read_data <read_data>` command to define
the simulation box and read in a data file of atom coordinates, the
default "zlo zhi" values are -0.5 0.5 for 2d simulations.  If the data
file includes that header keyword the zlo/zhi values must straddle z =
0.0.  Also, the z coord for each atom listed in the file must be 0.0.
A value within epsilon of zero is also allowed in case the data file
was generated by another program with finite precision, in which case
the z coord for the atom will be set to 0.0.

Use the :doc:`fix enforce2d <fix_enforce2d>` command as the last fix
defined in the input script.  It ensures that the z-components of
velocities and forces are zeroed out every timestep.  The reason to
make it the last fix is so that any forces added by other fixes will
also be zeroed out.

Many of the example input scripts included in the examples directory
are for 2d models.

.. note::

   Some models in LAMMPS treat particles as finite-size spheres, as
   opposed to point particles.  See the :doc:`atom_style sphere
   <atom_style>` and :doc:`fix nve/sphere <fix_nve_sphere>` commands
   for details.  By default, for 2d simulations, such particles will
   still be modeled as 3d spheres, not 2d discs (circles), meaning
   their moment of inertia will be that of a sphere.  If you wish to
   model them as 2d discs, see the :doc:`set density/disc <set>`
   command and the *disc* option for the :doc:`fix nve/sphere
   <fix_nve_sphere>`, :doc:`fix nvt/sphere <fix_nvt_sphere>`,
   :doc:`fix nph/sphere <fix_nph_sphere>`, :doc:`fix npt/sphere
   <fix_npt_sphere>` commands.
