This folder used to contain a bundled version of [i-PI](https://ipi-code.org).
However, the bundled version was not updated and thus had become outdated.

i-PI is now available via PyPi using the pip package manager at:
https://pypi.org/project/i-PI/

Here are the commands to set up a virtual environment and install i-PI
into it with all its dependencies.

``` sh
python -m venv ipienv
source ipienv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install i-PI
```

For further information, please consult the [i-PI home page](https://ipi-code.org).
